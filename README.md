In this Project, users can look for every game that they have in mind. 
they can filter the games by Genres, Platforms and also can sort them by Name, Date and etc...

This project used Chakra UI for Styling, Zustand for state managment, react query for quering the data AND react router to route between pages.
 
I also deployed it on vercel.
